## üßæ **Project Summary for AI Context**

I‚Äôm building a **cross-platform GUI desktop app for RoboCup SSL**, using:

### üß± Tech Stack:
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Desktop App**: Electron
- **Real-time communication**: WebSocket (from a Qt6 C++ backend)
- **Data rate**: Every 16ms, backend sends JSON packets
- **Goal**: Render robot and ball states on a field in real-time

### üîÑ WebSocket Data Format (from backend):

```json
{
  "robots": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "team": "blue",
      "position": { "x": 0.5, "y": 0.4 },
      "velocity": { "x": 0.1, "y": 0.2 },
      "orientation": 1.57
    }
    // Up to 22 robots
  ],
  "ball": {
    "position": { "x": 0.9, "y": 0.3 },
    "velocity": { "x": 0.03, "y": 0.01 },
    "orientation": 0.0
  }
}
```

### üß† Functional Goals:
- Open the GUI **in a native desktop window** (not in a browser)
- Render the field using **SVG or Canvas**
- Show robots with color by team, ID labels, orientation (arrow), and velocity (vector)
- Ball position and movement
- Future: switch to FlatBuffers or binary if JSON slows down

### ‚úÖ My Stack Is Ready

I‚Äôve already:
- Set up **Electron + Vite + React + TypeScript**
- Installed WebSocket client
- Connected to the backend (localhost:9001)

---

### ‚ùìWhat I Want from You (AI):
Examples or help with:
- SVG or Canvas-based robot + ball field rendering
- Managing state updates from WebSocket cleanly
- Packaging into `.AppImage` or `.deb` for Ubuntu
- Optimizations or animations
- UI components (like toggles, team filters, FPS display)
